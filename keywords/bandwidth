## Bandwidth

In terms of electronics, bandwidth is the range of frequencies occupied by a 
radio frequency signal, usually measured in hertz. [^britan25band]

Bandwidth can refer to the capacity of a connection to handle data. For example, a higher bandwidth means that more data can be transferred at once, allowing for faster downloads, video streaming, and overall better network performance. [^fivestar21band]
